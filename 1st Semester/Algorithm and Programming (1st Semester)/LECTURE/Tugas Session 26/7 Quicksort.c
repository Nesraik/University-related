Quicksort

21 5 56 90 42 12

take 12 as pivot

take element from the left that is bigger than 12

21 is bigger than 12

take element from the right that is smaller than 12

5 is smaller than 12

swap 21 and 5

5 21 56 90 42 12

take element from the left that is bigger than 12

21 is bigger

take element from the right that is smaller than 12

5 is smaller than 12 but 5's element is smaller than 12's element hence swap 21 and 12

5 12 56 90 42 21

12 as pivot is already on a correct posisiton

repeat this process for the number after 12

56 90 42 21

take 21 as pivot

take element from the left that is bigger than 21

56 is bigger

since there's no element that is smaller than 21

swap 56 and 21

5 12 21 90 42 56

21 as a pivot is already on a correct position

90 42 56

take 56 as pivot

take element from the left that is bigger than 56

90 is bigger than 56

take element from the right that is smaller than 56

42 is smaller than 56

swap 90 and 42

42 90 56

take element from the left that is bigger than 56

90 is bigger than 56

take element from the right that is smaller than 56

since 42's element is smaller than 90's element

swap 90 and 56

42 56 90

5 12 21 42 56 90

sorted
