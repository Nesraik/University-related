/* from the condition above the answer for f is positive number
and b is negative number, since int data type and float data type can represent
positive and negative both f and b could have the same data type
or both  f and b can have different data type if f is declared as integer and 
b is declared as float since both integer data type and float data type can
represent both positive and negative number
